- Adjust execution speed
- Start, pause, and reset animations
- Generate random arrays
- View total swaps and comparisons
- Compare algorithms side by side
- Real-time execution timing

## Technologies Used

- **React** with hooks
- **Styled Components** + Material-UI
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Vite** as bundler

## Technical Implementation

- Pure CSS animations using FLIP principle
- Flexbox for array display and position manipulation
